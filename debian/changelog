  * Drop ttf-liberation per default, it seem to render poorly in
    mozilla.
  * Add feh so that fluxbox can set a background.

    what mechanism should be used for starting the bluetooth services,

    module.
  * Whitelist bluz-utils initscripts again.

  [ Stefan Lippers-Hollmann ]

    post-lenny.
  * remove FileType preconfiguration from vimrc.local, it's erroring out.
  * add zenity to XFCE.

  * disable kvm for the time being.

  [ Bernard Gray ]
  * move hplip-gui to kde-desktop - it pulls in 88MB qt libs, tx ModestUser

   - this is useful for kde4 testing, and is ignored if commented
  * add commented debian-experimental repo section as example for kde4 testing

  [ Joaquim Boura ]
  * splited xfce into xfce and xfce-lite.
  * use xarchiver instead of thunar-archive-plugin as this needs ark or
    file-roller.

  [ Ferdinand Thommes ]

      - aqualung is left as the default music player
  * partial revert 18631 - domino -> qtcurve
  * update hwsupport-printscan for cupsys -> cups transition
   From 1.3.7-6 changelog:
